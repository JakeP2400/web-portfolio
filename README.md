# Jake Pole - Cyber Security and Networking

I am a passionate Computer Science student with a strong development in Networking and Cyber Security, passionate about securing individuals and companies. I excel on the understanding of how different systems communicate, building secure environments and managing vulnerabilities. Building related projects to develop my skills and explore more into the landscape.

I am currently studying at the University of Plymouth, and currently in the final few weeks of my placement year working within the University of Plymouth's Information Security Team as an Enterprise Security Analyst. I will be finishing my studies in May 2026 and looking to further persue my career from there.
