      I have a massive passion for learning and Computer Science! I love learning new technologies and further developing my knowledge.
      In my Industry Experience, I have found that I have a strong understanding and knowledge of <a className="md:font-bold">Microsoft Defender XDR</a>. 
      As well as this, I enjoy <a className="md:font-bold">building networks</a> and associated skills. I also enjoy <a className="md:font-bold">Web Development</a> and recently I have developed my learning of <a className="md:font-bold">TypeScript, Next.js and TailwindCSS</a> in creating this page.

      <p>
      During my Year in Industry, I learnt a lot in relation to <a className="md:font-bold">ITIL</a> and completed the ITIL v4 Foundation course and earned myself the Certification.
      This became a large part of my job as I specialised in incident response, and dealing with Incidents and Changes became a natural part of the job.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I also have developed my understanding of the <a className="md:font-bold">Networking Principles</a>, as I have hopes of continuing my learning and understanding to achieve my <a className="md:font-bold">CCNA cerification</a>.
